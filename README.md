Plant Disease Prediction
Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting plant diseases based on images. The goal of this project is to help farmers and researchers quickly identify diseases affecting various plants, allowing for timely intervention and treatment.
Dataset

The model is trained using a labeled dataset of plant images that represent healthy plants and those affected by different diseases. Each image is categorized into one of many classes corresponding to specific plant diseases or healthy conditions.
Model

The model uses [mention model architecture, e.g., CNN or ResNet] for image classification. Key steps include:

    Data preprocessing (image normalization, resizing)
    Model training and evaluation
    Generating classification reports

Results

The model's performance is evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score. Although results may vary depending on class balance and image quality, the goal is to achieve high accuracy in disease classification.
